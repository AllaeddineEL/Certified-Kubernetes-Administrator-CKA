# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

This repository is a collection of resources that I am using in my preparation for Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (CNCF) Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. At the moment this is just a list of useful (or useless?) links but will be completed by the time.

There is a lot pre-existing collections of material and great writings regarding CKA preparation, this one is mainly my personal record of topics I am planning to go thru or have went thru and at the same time a way to keep track of progress.

## About the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Program

"The Cloud Native Computing Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment. The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program is to provide assurance that CKAs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators." - https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/

### Preparation Cource

"The Linux Foundation course Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258) maps directly to the requirements for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation." - https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/kubernetes-fundamentals
