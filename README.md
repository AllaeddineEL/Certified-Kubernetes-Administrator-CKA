# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

## About

This repository is a collection of resources that I am using in my preparation for [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. At the moment this is just a list of useful (or useless?) links but will be completed by the time.

There is a lot pre-existing collections of material and great writings regarding CKA preparation already available and all the glory they deserve for them. This specific repository is mainly my personal record of topics I am planning to go thru or have went thru and at the same time sort of a way to keep track of my progress. Nevertheless, in OSS spirit, I decided to open my notes to you.

## Contribution

The content in this repository is far from complete, so if you have ideas how to complement it, please create an issue or what would be even more impressive, a pull request. In any other kind of queries I recommened to contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikovirtala) or Slack. — All the kind of study and/or exam tips and tricks are warmly welcome. :)

## Motivation

I have used Docker since 2014, Swarm as a orchestrator since Docker 1.12 release and currently working in an enviroment where our container platform is self-managed Docker Enterprise Edition installation on top of AWS resources. [Docker, Inc.](https://www.docker.com/) released its plans to bring Kubernetes in to their EE and Desktop products in [DockerCon](https://2018.dockercon.com/) EU 2017 and this gives me a great reason to learn Kubernetes and aside of learning achieve the coveted and prestigious Certified Kubernetes Administrator title.

## About the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Program

_"The Cloud Native Computing Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment. The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program is to provide assurance that CKAs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators."_ — https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/

### Official Preparation Cource

_"The Linux Foundation course Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258) maps directly to the requirements for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation."_ — https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/kubernetes-fundamentals

### Exam Curriculum
Exam curriculum as it stands in January 2018. — It is mainly mapped to the official Kubernetes Concepts / Documentation / Tasks / Tutorials but there are also some good exceptions. Once there is \[✓\] sign on the right side of the topic, I have went thru it least once.
