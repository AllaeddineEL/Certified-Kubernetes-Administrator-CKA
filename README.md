# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

## About

This repository is a collection of resources that I am using in my preparation for Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (CNCF) Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. At the moment this is just a list of useful (or useless?) links but will be completed by the time.

There is a lot pre-existing collections of material and great writings regarding CKA preparation, this one is mainly my personal record of topics I am planning to go thru or have went thru and at the same time a way to keep track of progress.

## Motivation

I have used Docker since 2014, Swarm as a orchestrator since Docker 1.12 release and currently working in an enviroment where our container platform is self-managed Docker Enterprise Edition installation on top of AWS  resources. Docker released its plans to bring Kubernetes in to their EE and Desktop products in DockerCon EU 2017 and this gives me a great reason to learn Kubernetes and aside of learning achieve the coveted and prestigious Certified Kubernetes Administrator title.
